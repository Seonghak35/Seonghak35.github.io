I am a researcher at [ADD](https://add.re.kr/eps), where I focus on applying various artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including computer vision, to real-world applications. <strong>My research aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI advancements and practical implementation.</strong>

<h3><strong>My Research Journey</strong></h3>

I have always been deeply fascinated by <strong>understanding and analyzing complex flow phenomena that are omnipresent in our surroundings.</strong> These phenomena are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which are notoriously difficult to solve analytically. This challenge led me to develop a strong interest in `Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)`, where differential operators are replaced with numerical approximations to solve such problems.

During my studies at [SNU](https://aerospace.snu.ac.kr/en), I conducted research on `multiphase flows`, which are significantly more complex than single-phase flows. Specifically, I focused on `bubble dynamics` to investigate the effects of phase change on bubble behavior. <strong>My research was recognized with the Best Paper Award at [NCFE](https://ncfe.or.kr/en), highlighting its significance in the field.</strong>

Through this research, <strong>I realized the challenges of setting numerous user-defined parameters in fluid simulations, which sparked my interest in utilizing `artificial intelligence (AI)` for flow analysis.</strong> Pursuing this interest, I continued my studies at [KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en), where I had the opportunity to explore state-of-the-art AI technologies. I delved into `computer vision` and `model compression`, particularly `knowledge distillation (KD)`, which enhances the efficiency of AI applications.

Although my initial motivation for exploring AI was to overcome the limitations of CFD, <strong>I soon became deeply invested in AI itself as it rapidly evolves and influences various disciplines.</strong> Now, my research is primarily centered on advancing AI methodologies and applying them to real-world industrial and defense technologies.

In the future, if the opportunity arises, I hope to return to my original visionâ€”developing AI techniques that can push the boundaries of traditional CFD. Through my work, <strong>I aspire to contribute to both Korea's industrial growth and the advancement of military technologies.</strong>
