My keen interest lies in <strong>comprehending and analyzing the complex flow phenomena omnipresent in our surroundings</strong>, governed by the challenging Navier-Stokes equations. The near-impossibility of analytically solving this equation fuels my fascination with `computational fluid dynamics (CFD)`, a field adept at addressing it by substituting differential operators with numerical counterparts.

During my studies at [SNU](https://aerospace.snu.ac.kr/), I delved into researching `multiphase flows`, which are more complicated than single-phase flows. Specifically, I concentrated on `bubble dynamics`, employing advanced numerical methods. My research, which scrutinized the impact of phase change on bubble dynamics, earned recognition with the Best Paper Award at the NCFE.

Recognizing the challenges related to setting numerous user-defined parameters in flow simulation during that research, my interest evolved towards leveraging `artificial intelligence (AI)` for simulating flows.

At [KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/), I had opportunities to learn state-of-the-art AI technologies, ranging from `computer vision` that have the potential to utilize experimental or numerical results as image data to `model compression` that can improve the efficiency of AI applications.

Currently, my interests are centered on researching both `neural operators` that can more directly apply AI to fluid computation and `numerical operators`. I believe that this dual focus can explore innovative approaches, aiming to overcome the inherent limitations of traditional computational methods. By intertwining my past accomplishments with my current research focus, <strong>I aspire to contribute significantly to the intersection of fluid dynamics and AI.</strong>
