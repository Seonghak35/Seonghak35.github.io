## Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Many physical phenomena around us are governed by *advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations*. 

In the scalar case (single equation), it can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial f(q)}{\partial x}=s(x, t, q)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\alpha \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\right)
\end{equation}

* $$ q=q(x, t) $$ is the *unknown* <U>dependent variable</U> and a function of two <U>independent variables</U> $$ x $$ and $$ t $$.
* $$ f(q) $$ is the *flux*.
* $$ s(x,t,q) $$ is the *source term*
* $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\alpha \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\right) $$ is the *diffusion term*, which is second-order differential operator.
* $$ \alpha=\alpha(x,t,q) $$ is the *diffusion coefficient*.

### Linear Equation

The <U>linear</U> advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation, obtained by setting the flux function as linear function of $$q$$, $$f(q)=\lambda q$$, and the source function as linear function of $$q$$, $$s(q)=\beta q$$, can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=\beta q+\alpha \frac{\partial^2 q}{\partial x}
\label{eq:le}
\end{equation}

with $$\lambda$$, $$\beta$$, and $$\alpha$$ of constants.

Assuming that there is no advection, $$\partial_x q=0$$, and no diffusion, $$\alpha=0$$, Eq. \eqref{eq:le} becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE) as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d q}{d t}=\beta q(x,t) \equiv s(t,q)
\end{equation}

## Initial Value Problem (IVP)

By setting source coefficient and diffusion coefficient as zero, the linear advection equation (LAE) can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=0
\label{eq:lae}
\end{equation}

with characteristic speed $$(\lambda)$$.

Because of initial value problem, the spatial domain is infinite $$(-\infty< 0< \infty)$$, i.e., no spatial boundaries, and time $$(t>0)$$ is positive. An initial condition at time $$(t=0)$$ is provided as follows:

\begin{equation}
q(x,0)=h(x)
\end{equation}

## Characteristic Curves
Eq. \eqref{eq:lae} can be expressed by <U>characteristic curves</U>, which is function, $$x(t)$$, defined in the $$x$$-$$t$$ half-plane of independent variables $$(x, t)$$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d x(t)}{d t}=\lambda
\end{equation}

satisfying the IVP $$x(0)=x_0$$. This solution can be easily obtained as follows:

\begin{equation}
x(t)=x_0+\lambda t
\end{equation}

where $$x_0$$ is <U>foot of the characteristic</U> and the characteristic speed $$(\lambda)$$ determines the slope of the characteristics. Therefore, in case of linear case with constant $$\lambda$$, characteristics are all parallel to each other.

In order to obtain the solution $$(q)$$ of original PDE equation, Eq. \eqref{eq:lae}, consider that the time-rate of change of $$q$$ along a characteristic curve $$x=x(t)$$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}\frac{d t}{d x}+\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\frac{d x}{d t}=\partial_{t}q+\lambda \partial_{x}q=0
\end{equation}

As a result, the linear advection equation $$\partial_{t}q+\lambda \partial_{x}q=0$$ (PDE) becomes the ODE $$d_{t}q=0$$ along the characteristics, $$x=x_{0}+\lambda t$$. This states that $$q$$ is constant along the characteristics $$x=x_{0}+\lambda t$$. In other words, the value of $$q(x,t)$$ at arbitrary point $$(x,t)$$ is equal to the value of $$q$$ at the foot $$x_0$$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
q(x,t)=q(x_0,t)=h(x_0)=h(x-\lambda t)
\label{eq:charac}
\end{equation}

### Proof

To see that the function $$q(x,t)$$ in Eq. \eqref{eq:charac} is the exact solution of the original IVP, Eq. \eqref{eq:lae}, assume that the initial condition $$h(x)$$ is differentiable (i.e. <U>smooth function</U>).

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial h}{\partial (x-\lambda t)}\times \frac{\partial (x-\lambda t)}{\partial t} \equiv h'\times(-\lambda)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial h}{\partial (x-\lambda t)}\times \frac{\partial (x-\lambda t)}{\partial x} \equiv h'\times(\lambda)
\end{equation}

Substituting these partial derivatives into the original PDE,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=-\lambda h'+\lambda h'=0.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the function $$q(x,t)=h(x-\lambda t)$$ is the solution of the original PDE.

## Riemann Problem

The Riemann problem for the linear advection equation is the special IVP including the <U>discontinuity</U> solution as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=0
\end{equation}

with initial condition 

$$
h(x) = q_L,\quad \text {if} x<0
$$

\begin{equation}
h(x) = q_R,\quad \text {if} x>0
\end{equation}

At the point $$x=0$$, the solution is not defined, i.e., <U>singularity</U>.

The solution is as follows:

$$
q(x,t)=h(x-\lambda t) = q_L,\quad \text { if } x-\lambda t<0
$$

\begin{equation}
q(x,t)=h(x-\lambda t) = q_R,\quad \text { if } x-\lambda t>0
\end{equation}

## Initial-Boundary Value Problem (IBVP)

In most practical problem, the boundaries are present and then have to be defined in a finite spatial domain $$x\in[a,b]$$ as follows:

$$
q(a,t)=b_{L}(t)
$$

\begin{equation}
  q(b,t)=b_{R}(t)
\end{equation}

In addition to IC, the boundary conditions are need for computation.

For $$\lambda >0$$, the solution in domain $$x\in[a,b]$$ depends on the IC and the left BC because the values at left BC are constantly propagated to the right as follows:

$$
q(x,t)=h(x-\lambda t)\quad\quad\quad \text{ if } x-\lambda t >a
$$

\begin{equation}
q(x,t)=b_L(t+\frac{a-x}{\lambda})\quad \text{ if } x-\lambda t <a
\end{equation}

## Generalization 

### Linear Advection-Reaction Equation

In addition ot LAE, the reaction term can be added in equation as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=\beta q.
\end{equation}

The exact solution can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
q(x,t)=h(x-\lambda t)\exp(\beta t),
\end{equation}

where $$q$$ represents a wave traveling at speed $$\lambda$$, attenuated in time by the factor $$\exp(\beta t)$$. For stability of the PDE, it is assumed that $$\beta \le 0$$. In case of $$\beta >0$$, $$q$$ would increase unboundedly in time, i.e., unstable.

### Advection with Variable Coefficient

In case that the coefficient is not constant, $$\lambda$$, but variable, $$\lambda (x,t)$$, the equation can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda (x,t) \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}=0.
\end{equation}

The characteristic speed $$\lambda (x,t)$$ is no longer constant but a function of space and time. Thus, the associated characteristics are no longer straight lines and no longer parallel to each other although the solution is constant along the characteristics.


### Linear Advection-Reaction in 3D

The linear advection-reaction equation in three space dimensions can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+\lambda_1\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}+\lambda_2\frac{\partial q}{\partial y}+\lambda_3\frac{\partial q}{\partial z}=\beta q,
\end{equation}

with initial condition, $$q(x,y,z,0)=h(x,y,z)$$, where $$\lambda_1, \lambda_2$$, and $$\lambda_3$$ denote the characteristic speeds in the $$x, y$$, and $$z$$ direction, respectively.

The exact solution can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
q(x,y,z,t)=h(x-\lambda_1 t, y-\lambda_2 t,z-\lambda_3 t)\exp(\beta t).
\end{equation}
